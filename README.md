# Modern Todo Application

A full-stack, production-ready task management application showcasing Spec-Driven Development (SDD) principles and modern technologies.

## Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive todo application developed in multiple phases, demonstrating progressive development approaches and architectural decisions following Spec-Driven Development principles.

## Completed Phases

### Phase I - Command-Line Todo Application
A feature-rich command-line todo application built with Python 3.13 following Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles and Spec-Driven Development methodology. Key features include:
- Task management (add, view, update, delete, mark complete)
- Input validation with clear error messages
- In-memory storage with sequential IDs
- Rich console UI with formatted tables
- Comprehensive test coverage (100% on core business logic)

### Phase II - Full-Stack Web Application
A modern full-stack todo application built with Next.js 16, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL. Features include:
- Next.js 16 frontend with React 19 and TypeScript
- FastAPI backend with SQLModel ORM
- PostgreSQL database with proper migrations
- Better Auth integration for authentication
- Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui
- Real-time updates and PWA capabilities
- Complete API with JWT validation

## Phase III - Coming Soon
Next phase will continue to build upon the foundations established in previous phases, incorporating advanced features and architectural improvements.
