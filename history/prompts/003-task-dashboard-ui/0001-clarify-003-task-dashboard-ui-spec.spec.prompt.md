## Prompt

Identify underspecified areas in the current feature spec by asking up to 5 highly targeted clarification questions and encoding answers back into the spec.

## Response snapshot

I asked 5 questions to clarify ambiguities in the feature specification regarding task status mapping, frontend framework, UI rate limiting, observability, and default sorting. The specification file was updated with the user's answers.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: High
- 🧪 Tests: (none)
- 📁 Files: 1 file updated
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.plan 003-task-dashboard-ui
- 🧠 Reflection: The clarification process was successful in identifying and resolving key ambiguities in the spec before planning.
