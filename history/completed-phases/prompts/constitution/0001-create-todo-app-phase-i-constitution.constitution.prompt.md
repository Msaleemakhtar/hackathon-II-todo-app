## Prompt

create the constitution using following content # Todo App - Phase I Constitution

## Mission Statement

Build a foundational command-line todo application that demonstrates mastery of spec-driven development. This phase serves as the cornerstone for future evolution into a cloud-native, AI-powered distributed system.

## Core Principles

### I. Spec-Driven Development (Mandatory)
**Philosophy**: The specification is the source of truth; AI is the implementation engine.

**Requirements**:
- ALL application code must be generated by an AI agent from written specifications.
- Manual coding of features, business logic, or UI is **strictly forbidden**, with one exception.
- **Exception for AI Limitations**: In the rare event that the AI code generator cannot produce a correct implementation for a well-defined specification after three refinement cycles, a developer may manually write the minimum necessary code. This action must be documented as a 'justified deviation' and reviewed by the team.
- Development follows a continuous cycle: **Spec → AI Generate → Test → Refine Spec → Regenerate**.
- Specifications must be managed via GitHub Spec-Kit Plus.

**Verification**:
- Commit history shows specification files created/modified before implementation.

### II. Console-First Interface (CLI Only)
**Philosophy**: Simplicity through text-based interaction.

**Requirements**:
- Pure command-line interface using Python's standard input/output.
- Interactive menu-driven navigation with numbered options.
- Clear, human-readable prompts and responses.
- Formatted text output for task display.
- No graphical user interface (GUI) of any kind.

**User Experience Standards**:
- Main menu displayed on startup with 6 options (5 features + Exit).
- All user inputs validated with helpful error messages.
- Success confirmations after every operation.
- Ability to return to main menu from any screen.
- Graceful exit mechanism (no forced termination).

### III. Ephemeral In-Memory State (No Persistence)
**Philosophy**: Keep it simple; state lives only during runtime.

**Requirements**:
- Task storage exclusively in Python data structures (list, dict, or similar).
- NO file I/O operations (no reading/writing files).
- NO database connections (SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc.).
- NO serialization to disk (pickle, JSON files, etc.).
- Application state is completely lost upon termination.

**Verification**:
- Restart application → all tasks disappear.
- No `.txt`, `.json`, `.db`, or similar files created in project directory.
- Code review confirms absence of file operations or database imports.

### IV. Python & UV Ecosystem (Technology Stack)
**Philosophy**: Modern Python with cutting-edge tooling.

**Requirements**:
- **Python Version**: 3.13 or newer (leverage latest features).
- **Package Manager**: UV exclusively for dependency and environment management.
- **Project Configuration**: `pyproject.toml` must exist and define project metadata.
- **Virtual Environment**: Managed by UV (no manual venv creation).
- **Dependencies**: `pytest` for testing; otherwise, standard library ONLY.

### V. Clean Code Standards (Quality Mandate)
**Philosophy**: AI-generated code must meet professional standards.

**Requirements**:
- **Type Hints**: All function signatures must include type annotations.
- **Docstrings**: All functions and classes must have Google-style docstrings.
- **PEP 8 Compliance**: Follow Python style guide strictly.
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of invalid inputs with clear error messages and error code.
- **Code Organization**: Logical separation of concerns (models, storage, operations, UI, main).
- **No Magic Numbers**: Use named constants for validation limits (e.g., `MAX_TITLE_LENGTH = 200`).

**Code Quality Tools**:
- **Linter**: `ruff check .` must pass with zero errors.
- **Formatter**: `ruff format --check .` must confirm code is formatted.
- **Type Checker** (Optional but Recommended): `mypy src/` should pass.

### VI. Automated Testing (Mandatory)
**Philosophy**: If it's not tested, it's broken.

**Requirements**:
- For every feature specification, a corresponding test specification must be created.
- Automated unit tests must be written (or generated) using `pytest` to validate the business logic of each feature.
- Tests must cover valid inputs, invalid inputs (e.g., incorrect types, out-of-range values), and edge cases (e.g., empty lists, boundary values).

**Verification**:
- A `/tests` directory exists with test files corresponding to application modules.
- All tests must be executable via the command `uv run pytest`.
- The full test suite must pass with 100% coverage of all core logic before a feature is considered complete.

### VII. Core Functionality Scope (Feature Freeze)
**Philosophy**: Master the basics before adding complexity.

**Fixed Feature Set (No Additions)**:
1. **Add Task** - Create new todo with title and optional description.
2. **View Tasks** - Display all tasks with ID, title, status, and timestamps.
3. **Update Task** - Modify existing task's title or description.
4. **Delete Task** - Remove task from list by ID.
5. **Mark Complete** - Toggle task completion status.

**Explicitly Out of Scope**:
- ❌ Priorities (high/medium/low)
- ❌ Tags or categories
- ❌ Search or filtering
- ❌ Sorting options
- ❌ Due dates or reminders
- ❌ Recurring tasks
- ❌ Multi-user support
- ❌ Data export/import

## Response snapshot

Successfully created the Todo App Phase I Constitution (version 1.0.0) at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`. The constitution establishes seven core principles for spec-driven development: AI-first code generation, CLI-only interface, ephemeral in-memory state, Python 3.13+ with UV tooling, clean code standards with type hints and docstrings, mandatory automated testing with 100% coverage, and a fixed five-feature scope. The document includes comprehensive task data model specifications, validation rules, success criteria, constraints, and governance policies.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created foundational governance document defining all development principles, technical standards, and success criteria for Phase I
- 🧪 Tests: None (constitution document does not require tests)
- 📁 Files: Created .specify/memory/constitution.md with complete constitution v1.0.0
- 🔁 Next prompts: Create feature specifications following constitution principles, initialize Python project structure with UV, define tests for the five core features
- 🧠 Reflection: The constitution successfully codifies all seven principles with clear rationale, verification criteria, and governance rules. Templates are compatible with the constitution requirements.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - constitution created successfully on first attempt
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Manual review of consistency with templates - PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A - Initial constitution creation
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A - Constitution established as baseline
